# The OpenConsult data standard

**OpenConsult** is a draft open standard for publishing data about public consultations.

This is a standard that governments, and other organizations that regulary consult with the public, can use to share information about upcoming, ongoing, and completed consultations.

This is a standard that citizens' groups, other governments, and businesses can use to create services that recieve data from multiple conulting organizations for re-publication, re-purposing and research.

If you have opinions about the standard please [submit an issue](https://github.com/bcgov/openconsult/issues) here, or get in touch at <hugh@placespeak.com>.
